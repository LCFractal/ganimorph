# GANimorph: Improved Shape Deformation in Unsupervised Image to Image Translation

This repo hosts the official code for Improved Shape Deformation in Unsupervised Image to Image Translation.

# Dataset
The Microsoft Research Kaggle Cat vs. Dog Dataset serves as an excellent demo. Simply download the dataset and remove 128 examples from the holdout list.



More Datasets Hopefully Coming Soon.

# Dependencies

Tensorflow > 1.2 (GPU strongly recomended)
This repo uses the Tensorpack library at commit 01cab873feced688070d3ab113530f03c2525723 and all relevent dependencies.
