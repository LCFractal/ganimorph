# Coming soon

We are just setting up the repo, and we will fill in details about datasets and pre-build models soon. Thank you for your patience.

# Dataset
The Microsoft Research Kaggle Cat vs. Dog Dataset serves as an excellent demo. Simply download the dataset and remove 128 examples from the holdout list.

# Dependencies

Tensorflow > 1.2 (GPU strongly recomended)
This repo uses the Tensorpack library at commit 01cab873feced688070d3ab113530f03c2525723 and all relevent dependencies.
